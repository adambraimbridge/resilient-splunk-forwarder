## Introduction

Forwards logs cached in S3 to Splunk

## Installation

        go get -u github.com/Financial-Times/resilient-splunk-forwarder
        cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Financial-Times/resilient-splunk-forwarder
        go build -mod=readonly .

## Running locally

1. Run the tests and install the binary:

        go test -mod=readonly -race ./...
        ./resilient-splunk-forwarder

2. Run the binary (using the `help` flag to see the available optional arguments):

        $GOPATH/bin/resilient-splunk-forwarder [--help]

3. Test:

    The service reads and deletes objects from S3 and forwards them to the provided Splunk HEC URL, therefore local testing is not recommended.

## Build and deployment

* Built by Docker Hub on merge to master: [coco/resilient-splunk-forwarder](https://hub.docker.com/r/coco/resilient-splunk-forwarder/)
* CI provided by CircleCI: [resilient-splunk-forwarder](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/resilient-splunk-forwarder)

## Service endpoints

The app has no service endpoints.

## Healthchecks

Admin endpoints are:

`/__gtg`

`/__health`

`/__build-info`

There are several checks performed:

* Checks that the last S3 operation was successful
* Checks that the last Splunk operation was successful

Healthchecks incur no additional requests to external systems.

## Other information

There is a single thread listing objects from S3, but actual data is fetched asynchronously. Messages are immediately deleted from S3.
Messages are then dispatched to a set of workers that submit the data to the configured Splunk HEC URL.
Failed messages are stored again in S3. Failures also cause exponential backoff so that the endopint is not overwhelmed. 
However, due to having multiple workers, this will not affect messages that are already dispatched.  

### Logging

- The application uses [go-logger v2](https://github.com/Financial-Times/go-logger/tree/v2); the log file is initialised in [main.go](main.go).
- Logging requires an `env` app parameter, for all environments other than `local` logs are written to file.
- When running locally, logs are written to console. If you want to log locally to file, you need to pass in an env
parameter that is != `local`.
- NOTE: `/__build-info` and `/__gtg` endpoints are not logged as they are called every second from varnish/vulcand
and this information is not needed in logs/splunk.
