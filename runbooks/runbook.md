## Host Platform

AWS

## Architecture

The service reads and deletes objects (logs) from S3 and forwards them to the provided Splunk HEC URL. Logs are immediately deleted from S3. Logs are then dispatched to a set of workers that submit the data to the configured Splunk HEC URL. Failed logs are stored again in S3. Failures also cause exponential backoff so that the endopint is not overwhelmed. However, due to having multiple workers, this will not affect logs that are already dispatched.
